# crapper

CRAP scores for Clojure, Java, Go, TypeScript, Rust, Python, and Lua. One run detects the language of each source file, applies that language's complexity and coverage rules, and writes the snapshot [uml-viewer](https://github.com/unclebob/uml-viewer) already reads.

The formula is the one from [crap4clj](https://github.com/unclebob/crap4clj), [crap4java](https://github.com/unclebob/crap4java), and [crap4go](https://github.com/unclebob/crap4go):

```text
CRAP = CC² × (1 − coverage)³ + CC
```

`CC` is cyclomatic complexity. `coverage` is the fraction of the function exercised by tests. A score of 1–5 is low risk, 5–30 is worth a look, and 30+ is complex and under-tested.

## Run

```bash
./crapper
```

The first run creates `.venv` and installs the tool. From a project root it walks the tree, skips `test`, `spec`, `vendor`, `node_modules`, and `target`, and writes two results:

- a table on stdout, worst score first
- `.metrics/crap.edn`, replaced on every successful analysis

```bash
./crapper --no-coverage                  # complexity only; coverage is N/A
./crapper --use-existing-coverage        # read reports already on disk
./crapper src/demo/core.clj src/ui       # these files and trees
./crapper --changed                      # git additions and edits
./crapper combat                         # path fragment, same idea as crap4clj
./crapper --threshold 30                 # exit 2 when the worst score is higher
```

## Snapshot

`.metrics/crap.edn` has the same shape crap4clj writes:

```clojure
{:entries [{:name "place"
            :namespace "demo.Board"
            :complexity 3
            :coverage 75.0
            :crap 3.1}]}
```

uml-viewer groups entries by `:namespace` and joins each operation on `:name`. `nil` coverage means the function was found but no coverage data applied, and CRAP is `nil` too.

| Language | `:namespace` | `:name` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clojure | the `ns` | the `defn` / `defn-` name |
| Java | `package.Class`, or `package.Outer.Inner` | the method name |
| Go | the package import path, or `import/path.Receiver` | the function or method name |
| TypeScript | the dotted module path, or `module.Class` | the function or method name |
| Rust | `crate::module`, or `crate::module::Type` | the function or method name |
| Python | the dotted module path, or `module.Class` | the function or method name |
| Lua | the `require` path (`src/`, `lua/`, `src/lua/` and a trailing `init` dropped) | the name as written: `helper`, `M.foo`, `Account:deposit` |

Rename or move is a new entry. There is no identity matching across runs.

## What each language counts

Clojure follows crap4clj: `if` / `when` and their variants, `and`, `or`, `loop`, `catch`, and each clause of `cond`, `condp`, `case`, `cond->`, `cond->>`, `some->`, and `some->>`. Coverage prefers Cloverage's per-line form counts and falls back to LCOV.

Java follows crap4java: `if`, loops, `catch`, `?:`, each `switch` label, and `&&` / `||`. Constructors and methods inside anonymous classes are omitted. Coverage is JaCoCo's `INSTRUCTION` counter.

Go follows crap4go: `if`, `for`, `range`, each `switch` and `select` clause, and `&&` / `||`. Coverage is `go test -coverprofile`.

TypeScript and TSX use the same structural decisions as Java, including `&&` inside JSX. Top-level functions, class methods, and top-level arrow functions are entries. Nested callbacks stay inside the enclosing function. Coverage is LCOV. A `coverage` script is used as-is. A Vitest project runs `vitest --coverage` (installing `@vitest/coverage-v8` into `node_modules` when it is missing, without editing `package.json`). Other test scripts are wrapped in `c8`.

Rust counts `if`, loops, each `match` arm, `?`, and `&&` / `||`. `mod tests` is skipped. Coverage is LCOV from `cargo llvm-cov` or `cargo tarpaulin`, run in the nearest directory that contains `Cargo.toml`. When neither tool is installed, the run installs `cargo-llvm-cov`.

Python counts `if`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `except`, each `match` case, a comprehension filter, a conditional expression, and each `and` / `or`. Nested functions stay inside the enclosing function. Coverage is LCOV from `coverage.py`, running pytest when the project uses it and `unittest` otherwise. `coverage` and `pytest` are installed into the project's interpreter when they are missing.

Lua counts `if`, `elseif`, `while`, `repeat`, both `for` forms, and each `and` / `or`. `goto` does not count. Function declarations and function expressions assigned to a name are entries; nested functions and unassigned closures stay inside the enclosing function. Coverage is LCOV from busted with luacov and `luacov-reporter-lcov`, run with a Lua 5.4 interpreter (`lua5.4`, then `lua`) in the nearest directory that contains `.busted` or a rockspec. Nothing is installed automatically.

## Coverage commands

By default a run deletes the previous report for each language it is about to measure and regenerates it:

| Language | Command | Report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clojure | `clj -M:cov --lcov` (needs `deps.edn` or `bb.edn`) | `target/coverage/` |
| Java | JaCoCo Maven plugin `0.8.12` in each module with `pom.xml` | `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml` |
| Go | `go test ./... -coverprofile=...` | `target/coverage/go/coverage.out` |
| TypeScript | `npm run coverage`, or Vitest `--coverage`, or `npx c8 ... npm test` | `coverage/lcov.info` or `target/coverage/typescript/lcov.info` |
| Rust | `cargo llvm-cov` or `cargo tarpaulin`, per Cargo package | `target/coverage/rust/lcov.info` |
| Python | `coverage run` with pytest or unittest, then `coverage lcov` | `target/coverage/python/lcov.info` |
| Lua | Lua 5.4 runs the Busted and LuaCov entrypoint modules with coverage and the LCOV reporter | `target/coverage/lua/lcov.info` |

A missing tool or a failed test run leaves that language at N/A and still writes the snapshot. Pass `--coverage-command` to replace those defaults with one command of your own.

## Windows

crapper supports native Windows. Install Python 3.11 or later, then run these commands in PowerShell from the crapper checkout:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
.\.venv\Scripts\crapper.exe --root "C:\path\to\project"
```

Install the coverage tools for the languages in your project separately. Lua coverage needs Lua 5.4, busted, luacov, and luacov-reporter-lcov. Put `lua5.4` or `lua` on PATH. crapper resolves Windows Lua wrappers to the native interpreter and runs the coverage modules directly, so interpreter, project, and configuration paths can contain spaces.

The full test suite and Lua coverage with paths containing spaces were validated on Windows 11 with Python 3.12 and Lua 5.4.6. This does not verify every language's external coverage toolchain. Built-in commands use argument vectors; custom `--coverage-command` strings use the Windows shell.

WSL2 with Ubuntu is also an installation option:

1. In an administrator PowerShell, run `wsl --install` and reboot.
2. Open Ubuntu and clone into the Linux home directory, not `/mnt/c`.
   Windows drives are slow under WSL2 and break symlinks:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone -b lua https://github.com/TLOBillyQ/crapper.git
   ```

3. Run `crapper/scripts/setup-ubuntu.sh`. It installs Python, Lua 5.4,
   busted, luacov, and luacov-reporter-lcov, then creates `.venv`.
4. Edit in VS Code with the WSL extension (`code .` from Ubuntu).

Under WSL2, crapper warns when the project is under `/mnt/`.

## Development

On Windows, prepare and verify an environment for the current checkout:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-dev.ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

Pass `-Python "C:\path\to\python.exe"` to select the interpreter used to create `.venv`. The setup installs `.[dev]` and verifies the parser dependencies and checkout imports. Run it in each worktree, and give agents the verified interpreter's absolute path.

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

Local runs without the Lua toolchain can skip integration tests, so check the pytest summary before claiming Lua coverage was validated.
